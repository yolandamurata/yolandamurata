### Hi, I'm Yolanda 👋🏾

🎓 Third-year Biomedical Engineering student based in Türkiye.  
🧠 I’m deeply interested in neurotechnology — especially how brain signals like EEG can be decoded and used to design better medical devices.  
👩🏾‍💻 Currently diving into signal processing, MNE-Python, and biosignal visualization.

### 🧪 Current Focus
- Building a **sleep-signal tracking project** (EEG + biosignals) to strengthen my real-world signal-processing skills  
- Writing **LinkedIn explainers** on cutting-edge neurotech (closed-loop DBS, focused ultrasound, etc.)  
- Practicing **German 🇩🇪** during commutes  
- Sharpening **Python, Git, and data-analysis fundamentals**
